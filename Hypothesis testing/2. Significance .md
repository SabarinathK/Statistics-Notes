## Significance value (**α**)

=================

- Probability of _rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true_

- Example :

  When **α** = 0.05%,
  we allow 0.05% of risk to happen i.e., wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is being true

- Usually, the significance level of 0.01% is considered for the medical field and 0.05% for research and business.

## Confidence Interval

================

- Confidence Interval = 1 — Significance Level

- Example :

  When **α** = 0.05%,

  Confidence Interval = **1 — 0.05 = 0.95%**

  if null hypothesis rejected, we can 95% sure that we can reject the null hypothesis.
