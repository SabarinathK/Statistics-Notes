### p value

- A p value is used in hypothesis testing to help us to  *support* or _reject the null hypothesis_ .

1.  p value ≤ [significance level](2.%20Significance%20.md):
    - When p value is less than or equals to the [significance level](2.%20Significance%20.md) , we _reject the null hypothesis_
2.  p value > [significance level](2.%20Significance%20.md):
    - When p value is less than or equals to the [significance level](2.%20Significance%20.md) , we _failed reject the null hypothesis_
