 ### Null hypothesis :
- There is no difference in population
- *Example* :   
		   The dosage was __50m__
- It is denoted by **H0**


### Alternative hypothesis: 
- There is  difference in population 
- Also called as Research hypothesis
- _Example_ :   
		   The dosage was __not 50mg__  as same as before
- It is denoted by **Ha** or **H1**.


> Note : **H0 must always contain equality (=)**
               **Ha always contains difference (≠, >, <)**
               Two-tailed test, we define *H0: µ1 = µ2* and  *Ha: µ1≠µ2*
               One-tailed test, we define *H0: µ1 = µ2* and *Ha: µ1 > µ2* or *Ha: µ1 < µ2*
