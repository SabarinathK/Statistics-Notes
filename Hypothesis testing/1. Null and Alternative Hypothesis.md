## Null hypothesis :

- There is no difference in population
- _Example_ :
  - The dosage was **50m**
- It is denoted by **H0**

## Alternative hypothesis:

- There is difference in population
- Also called as Research hypothesis
- _Example_ :
  - The dosage was **not 50mg** as same as before
- It is denoted by **Ha** or **H1**.

> Note :
>
> **H0 must always contain equality (=)**
>
> **Ha always contains difference (≠, >, <)**
>
> Two-tailed test, we define _H0: µ1 = µ2_ and _Ha: µ1≠µ2_
>
> One-tailed test, we define *H0: µ1 = µ2* and *Ha: µ1 > µ2* or *Ha: µ1 < µ2*
